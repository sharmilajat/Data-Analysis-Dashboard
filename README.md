# 🌍 **Environment Temperature Change Analysis (NOAA/FAO)**

# 🧊 Excel Dashboard • Data Cleaning • Trend Analysis

This project analyzes global temperature change over time using the Environment Temperature Change (NOAA/FAO) dataset. The goal was to clean the data, transform it for analysis, and build an interactive Excel dashboard to highlight temperature trends across countries and years.

# 📁 **Project Overview**
This repository contains:

  ✔ Raw dataset (CSV)

  ✔ Cleaned & transformed dataset

  ✔ Excel file with Pivot Tables

  ✔ Interactive Excel Dashboard

  ✔ Documentation of the full workflow

# 🛠️ **Skills Used**

  - Data Cleaning (Power Query, Excel functions)

  - Unpivoting & transforming structured data

  - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

  - Slicers & Report Connections

  - KPI creation

  - Data visualization

  - Trend analysis

# 🔄 **Step-by-Step Workflow**
1️⃣ **Data Import**

  - Loaded the NOAA/FAO dataset into Excel.

2️⃣ **Data Cleaning** (Power Query)

  - Removed empty rows & duplicates

  - Checked and corrected data types (important for year & temperature)

  - Unpivoted temperature columns → created:

  - Year

  - Temperature

  - Temperature_Change

3️⃣ **Data Transformation**

  - Created new calculated fields:

  - Average temperature change since 1961

  - KPI indicator values

4️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis**

Identified:

  - Minimum & maximum temperature by year

  - Long-term warming trends

  - Country patterns

**5️⃣Dashboard Building**

  - Designed Pivot Tables

  - Connected slicers

  - Added KPIs, charts, formatting

  - Used consistent colors & layout
